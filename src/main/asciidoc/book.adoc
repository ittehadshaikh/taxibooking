= REST API Documentation for a Taxi Booking Server

== Book a taxi
A POST HTTP request with an URI of "/api/book" is used to book a taxi.
The body contains the coordinates for the source and the destination of the ride.

The HTTP response is always 200 OK.
The body of successful booking has the identifier of the taxi & the total time units for the ride.
The body of an unsuccessful booking is empty.

This is an example output for the service running at http://localhost:8080:

.request
include::{snippets}/book/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/book/http-response.adoc[]

.curl
include::{snippets}/book/curl-request.adoc[]

== Advance time by one unit
A PUT HTTP request with an URI of "/api/tick" is used to advance time by one unit.
This advances the clock for a ride by one unit.
Some ongoing ride(s) might complete and the taxi(s) become free again and available for booking.
When a taxi frees up, it is stationed at the destination of the ride.

The HTTP response is always 200 OK.

There is no body in either the request or the response.

This is an example output for the service running at http://localhost:8080:

.request
include::{snippets}/tick/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/tick/http-response.adoc[]

.curl
include::{snippets}/tick/curl-request.adoc[]

== Reset all taxis
A PUT HTTP request with an URI of "/api/reset" all taxis.
That means all taxis abort their current rides, if any and become available again.
Also, reposition themselves at the (0, 0) coordinates.

The HTTP response is always 200 OK.

There is no body in either the request or the response.

This is an example output for the service running at http://localhost:8080:

.request
include::{snippets}/reset/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/reset/http-response.adoc[]

.curl
